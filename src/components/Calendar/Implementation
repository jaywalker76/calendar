- Event rendering: 
    - event on same day
    - event spanning various days
    - multiple events on same day
        - how many events per day 
        - if more than 2 events per day
            - event starts in same day 

Specs:
- render: 
    - on cell: 
        - display event title: truncated -> display full title on tooltip (same day)

    - for events spanning multiple days: 
        - how to display the text? 
            - for the time being we are considering truncating the text; later will consider other options
            - for events spanning weeks, display event title on first cell
        - events spanning months:
            - starts at end of previous month, and in current month you only see the beginning of the representation
            - this hinges on the definition of first cell:
                - first cell: 
                    - of event (if in same week/month)
                    - of visible period (if event starts in previous month, for instance)

    - eventsFragment
        - one or more eventsFragments per cell
            - title: optional -> due to being rendered only on first cell for time being;
            implicitly, this will be only exist if it has to be rendered, and this will be inferred in the 
            background
            - isStart/isEnd -> used to apply caps to the event representation

Tests:
    - To be done at CalendarBody level
        - receives monthObject, enriched with event fragments 
        - test cases run on the enriched monthObject
- 
    
Reflect use cases in storybook

Considerations:
    - Should cells be isolated, maybe made into their own components?
        - needs other types of testing, focused on the cell behavior, rather than on the calendar 
        as a whole
        

Homework:
- specify test case scenarios for given specs
- consider overlaps and begin/end scenarios 
    - interval superpositions: as if in a straight line
